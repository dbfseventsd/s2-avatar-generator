# Soldat 2 Avatar Generator

This project was started to try out Mithril.js and a buildless web application. To deploy it, simply copy `index.html` file and `scripts`, `styles` and `assets` directories to an HTTP server.

Please note that text avatars require [Equalize font](https://www.dafont.com/equalize.font) (free for non commercial use) to be placed in `assets` directory.

## Development (or running locally)

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

Since the goal is to keep the project buildless, it does not contain TypeScript, but there are some type definitions and JSDoc hints for VS Code etc.
